'''

    What I added:
        - All of the basic UNO gameplay mechanics
        - The ability to play against the computer
        - UN0's special cards (Wild (card & +4), +2, reverse, skip)
            - The computer's ability to use special cards
        - Different modes of gameplay (beginner/easy/normal)
        - Multiplayer options
        - Improved reverse mechanics
        - Menu screen to contain & organize these features
        - Generalize player functions to adapt to computer plays
        - Team mode for even numbers (in multiplayer)
        - The ability to stack special cards to avoid picking up
            - The prevention of stacking +2 on top of a +4

    What I need to add/do:
        - The ability to reverse wild cards
        - Unique special cards (that are not in UNO)
        - Save/load game abilities
        - Ensure everything is modular & organized before submitting

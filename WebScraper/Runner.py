    TODO:
    - Figure out time issue with CBC (Mr. Rowell)
    - Finish top news scrape (send info in an organized way to file and compare the categories)

    Ideas for websites to scrape:
    - Youtube (today's trend list)
        - or Twitch (says whether there was a stream today (looks at past broadcasts date)
    - Newegg (updates lowest priced and best discounted PC parts)
    - Today's top news
        - gathers headlines from 5 news sites and compares categories to report trends
    - Twitter (gathers new tweets from specified user)
